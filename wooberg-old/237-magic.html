<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">237 Magic</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;display:block;">For this variant you may only use cards that have a
	casting cost of 2, 3 or 7&nbsp;and land. You may play cards that have additional cost, like kicker and
	buyback,&nbsp;as long as the base cost is 2, 3, or 7. For split cards do not count the casting&nbsp;cost of both
	side combined. Each side must meet the requirements. For&nbsp;example you could play Fire/Ice because both side have
	a casting cost of 2.<br /></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">Banned and Restricted List</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;display:block;">No individual cards are banned in this
	format.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually players agree on a Wizards of the Coast sanctioned format and play&nbsp;according to that
	restricted/banned list.<br /></div>
