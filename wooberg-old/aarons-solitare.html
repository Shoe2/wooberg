			<FONT size=+0>For this Solitaire variant you will use only one library. Your opponent will also use your
				deck. You and your imaginary opponent start with 20 life. Your goal is to reduce his life to 0 like a
				normal magic game. Use the following rules:</FONT>

			<FONT size=+0>You go first. Play your turn as normal. </FONT>

			<FONT size=+0>Next, take the top card off of the library and place it in your "opponent's" territory. Your
				opponent does not need mana to cast spells (not counting X spells, which are always zero unless there's
				lands that can be tapped or other mana sources in your opponents territory already). If the card makes
				no sense, discard it and draw again. If the card can be played on more than one card in play, use the
				following as a guideline, but in general try to do the best you can to damage your own position. In

			<FONT size=+0>Your opponent will always attack with all creatures that can. It will also always block with
				all creatures that can (unless they were tapped to attack). This includes Jade Statue if it has the mana

			<FONT size=+0>This seemingly stupid play makes up for the fact that your opponent can cast any spell without
				needing any mana. You will find that this comes out pretty even with a five-color deck of commons.
