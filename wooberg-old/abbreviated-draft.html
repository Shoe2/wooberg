<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">Abbreviated Draft (Cube Variant)</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><STRONG>The Drafting Sequence</STRONG><br /><br />Players
	obtain the cardpool from which they construct their decks (which must contain at least 60 cards, as in Constructed
	play, rather than 40 cards, as in Limited play) in three distinct steps.<br /><br />Each player is dealt twelve
	cards from a deck which will normally contain at least 20 cards times the number of players, and which will only
	contain one copy of any one card. Normally, this deck is intended to be composed of rare (and Mythic Rare) cards
	only. The direction of dealing, clockwise or counterclockwise, is determined by the preference of the first
	dealer.<br /><br />Players examine the cards they are dealt, and choose how many of those cards to keep, and how
	many of those cards to return. The player returning the most cards (if more than one player is tied for returning
	the most cards, one of them is chosen at random) receives the first draft pick in the next step.<br /><br />For this
	step, there are three options, one of which is to be agreed upon before play:<br /><br /><br /><br />
	<UL>
		<LI>Each player simultaneously and privately chooses to return a certain number of cards, then all the players
			return only those cards, and can make no further changes; </LI>
		<LI>Starting with the first player to whom a card was dealt, each player in turn chooses how many cards to
			return, and a player who does not return at least as many cards in total as the previous player returning
			the most cards drops out of the bidding for the first draft pick; </LI>
		<LI>Each player initially returns any number of cards, and then any player can choose to return more cards in
			order to become the top bidder until all players are satisfied. </LI>
	</UL><br /><br />The first is the quickest, the second the most orderly, and the third perhaps the most
	fair.<br /><br />A cube, normally containing at least 20 cards times the number of players, and with only one copy
	of each card in it, is now drafted from. Each player chooses one card from this cube, and then passes it on to the
	next player. Whether the cube is passed to the right (counterclockwise) or to the left (clockwise) is decided by a
	coin flip before this step begins if there are more than two players. Normally, this cube is intended to be composed
	of uncommon cards only.<br /><br />This cube is passed around between players until each player has had the
	opportunity to draft ten cards from it.<br /><br />Players then build their decks from the cards they retained from
	the rare cards they were dealt, the uncommon cards they drafted, and an additional cube that each player has for
	that player's use alone.<br /><br />It is intended that the cube of this type which each player has would be
	composed of common cards only. Either each player would have an identical cube, or, if that is impractical, cubes
	that are equally good would be distributed at random. These cubes should have at least 400 cards in
	them.<br /><br />Unlike Cube Draft, these cubes (like a player's deck, which again follows Constructed rather than
	Limited restrictions) may contain up to four copies of any one card.<br /><br />There is also a supply of basic
	lands available to the players for deck construction. This supply may include snow basic lands, if applicable based
	on the contents of the rare deck and the cubes in use.
