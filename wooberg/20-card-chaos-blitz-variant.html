	<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;">20 Card Chaos</h2>
	<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">This is the format that actually got me into magic,
		it's very aggressive and I'm sure if people wanted to break it they could, but it can also be a lot of
		fun.<br /><br />Basically it follows all standard magic rules besides the changes that follow:<br /><br />Type
		restrictions can be left up to your play group though my play group plays with no card restrictions besides the
		instant win combo type deck (protean flash etc.)<br /><br />Players use a minimum of a 60 card
		deck.<br /><br />Each player starts the game drawing the top 20 cards of his/her deck instead of
		7.<br /><br />The maximum hand size rule does not apply to each individual player until their hand has been
		reduced to The standard 7 cards at which point they will have to discard as normal if they exceed 7 cards at the
		end step.<br /><br />Players who have less than 7 cards at the draw step are allowed to draw cards equal to the
		difference of their hand size and 7 cards (every turn you can start at 7 cards in your hand if you choose)
		though you may choose to draw less if you were, for example, low on cards in your deck.<br /><br />Players may
		play any number of land each turn.<br /><br />Players start with 40 or 50 life<br /><br />This variant also
		works with the two-headed giant format using 80 or 100 life.</div>
