Emperor
Each team sits with the emperor in the middle and a guard on either side
The game is played like normal Magic Free For all games with a few changes.
Range
 There are 3 different ranges in Emperor 1-1-1, 1-2-1, and Global
In the 1-1-1 variant each players spells and abilitites can affect only players sitting one space away from them and their creatures may only attack that player; For instance, a Wrath of God will destroy only creatures controlled by you and by the players sitting one seat away on either side (the players right next to you); other players ' creatures are unaffected. Similarly, if you control a Howling Mine in a game, only  you and the two players sitting next to you get to draw an extra card each turn. Furthermore, your target choices are limited to you, the players sitting next to you, and the permanents in front of each of you, no matter who controls them.

In the 1-2-1 Variant, the emperor may target affect but not attack someone 2 seats away.  Otherwise this variant is no different.

In the Global variant, you play one of the previous variants listed above but global effects affect everyone.

Marching Creatures
You can move your creatures to your teammate 's territory, the space in front of your teammate where his or her cards go. This allows your creatures to block for your teammate and attack the opponents next to your teammate. You move creatures as part of declaring your attack; to move a creature, simply place it in the territory to which you 're moving it. Moving a creature counts as that creature 's attack for that turn and follows the same restrictions; if a creature can 't attack, you can 't move it either. Moving a creature taps and your moved creatures remain under your control - that is, you decide whether they attack or block, when to use their abilities, and whom they attack during your turn. But they can block attacks only for the player whose territory they occupy; they can 't block for you. Your moved creatures can attack only the players next to the player whose territory they occupy, not the players your creatures can normally attack. However, your moved creatures still attack during your combat phase, not your teammate 's, so your moved creatures and your teammate 's creatures can 't attack together

Eliminating players

 When one player dies, all of his cards are removed from play. This includes creatures which are in front of other players, or which have been controlled by the enemy. It also includes any enchantments, artifacts, and land controlled by that player. However, permanent effects, like +1/+1 counters, are not removed.  He also does not count as being seated any more, even if he does not stand, so effects and attacks now affect the next player in that direction.
